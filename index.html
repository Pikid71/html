        <h2>Claim</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="c">    In the story “Thank You M'am” by Langston Hughes, Mrs. Jones takes Roger home because she wants to teach him a lesson. </span>
            <span class="e">On page 3, lines 5 and 6, it states, “...a boy ran up behind her and tried to snatch her purse.” </span>
            <span class="r">My first piece of evidence supports my claim because stealing a purse is very wrong. </span>
            <span class="e">On page 4, lines 14 and 15, it states “...picked the boy up, and shook him until his teeth rattled.” </span>
            <span class="r">My second piece of evidence supports my claim because Roger will never forget the moment he felt like a rattlesnake. </span>
            <span class="e">On page 9, lines 152 and 153, it states “...do not make the mistake of latching into my pocketbook.” </span>
            <span class="r">My third piece of evidence supports my claim because she concluded with a sentence that assures he will never make the mistake again. </span>
            <span class="c">Therefore, Mrs. Jones took Roger home to teach him a lesson.</span>
